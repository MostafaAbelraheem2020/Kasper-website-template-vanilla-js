## Features

- Single-page layout with smooth section flow (landing, about, services, portfolio, pricing, contact, etc.).[3][1]
- Fully static front-end built using semantic HTML5 structure and organized CSS3 styles (no JavaScript logic required).[2]
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes using Flexbox, Grid, and media queries.[2]
- Simple, clean typography and color scheme inspired by the original Kasper theme design.[4][1]
- Reusable components such as header/navigation, section titles, cards/boxes, and footer.

## Project Structure

- `template-2.html` — main page file containing the full one-page layout.  
- `css/` — styles folder (main stylesheet, responsive rules, and any reset/normalize file).  
- `imgs/` — images used for backgrounds, sections, and icons.  
- `fonts/` or `webfonts/` — custom or web fonts used by the template (if included).

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 for the page markup and semantic structure (sections, headers, navigation, content blocks, footer).[2]
- CSS3 for layout, colors, typography, spacing, and responsiveness (Flexbox, Grid, media queries, transitions if used).[2]
- Optional assets such as custom fonts or icon libraries if included in the design (e.g., Google Fonts or Font Awesome).[5][1]

## How To Run

- Download or clone the project to your local machine.  
- Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or use a local development server such as Live Server in VS Code.  
- No build process or dependencies are required because the project is a static HTML/CSS template.
